Logbook System

A logbook is  a record of important events. It is essential , and must be filled in at least daily to track 
information specially this pandemic.The Logbook System holds the record for the different students, teachers 
and also visitors who go to a specific place like school, library or others. Though the manual process logbook 
and monitoring of people is still functional. But compared to an automated system, it is more functional because 
of its extra features such as a database which  will store the data and also solves the primary problems in 
finding the people. Manual  process of the logbook system is not secured, generating reports is also hard for 
the administrator because it requires a lot of paper in sorting, keeping of records and there are  instances 
of mishandling and loss of records. With the use of this  logbook system, managing of campus sports events 
or intramurals will be easier  because this system will save records to the database and generate reports with less hassle,time and effort.


In the homepage there is an automated time and date that exactly moves. There is a textbox there where the user will put his or her ID but 
before he / she puts it there. The admin must register his personal information. Once the admin registered the user, they can proceed in inputting his ID. 
There is a dropdown button above it which indicates time-in or time-out. The admin is the only one who can add users, update, delete and view the people who entered.
In the button view visitors, the admin can see who are the people who entered on that place, it shows the ID,Date,Time-in and Time Out.
